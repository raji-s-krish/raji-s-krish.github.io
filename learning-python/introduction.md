## Introduction

Let‚Äôs start from the basics.

Python is a programming language. What is a programming language? Programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computing device to perform specific tasks. There are so many programming languages - Python, Java, Ruby/Ruby on Rails, HTML, JavaScript, C Language, C++ - Python is obviously one among them.


Why we use Python at Qure? Python¬†is a more popular language for¬†AI¬†because¬†Python¬†is easy to learn and implement. With its many libraries, they can also be used for data analysis (most relevant for clinical research and statistical analysis at Qure).


If you are starting to learn programming for the first time (absolute beginners), and using this [link](https://folk.idi.ntnu.no/mlh/hetland_org/writing/instant-hacking.html) to learn it, start typing all the codes. The first day and probably for the first week (I might edit this later as it‚Äôs my second day at coding), you will have all sorts of syntax error due to mistakes in spacing, indentation, etc., But keep at it, will get better.


First, if you are using a Mac, Python is inbuilt - access it via TERMINAL (you might have never used this in Mac before). If you are using a Windows, Python has to be downloaded. For Mac, open TERMINAL, type ‚Äòpython‚Äô, press enter.


Second, you will also need a text editor (a software that helps you type the code more easily); here, I will be using Visual Studio Code. Once Visual Studio Code is set up, create a New file as learning.py or anyother.py in your home üè† folder. Although, for simple code, you can use the TERMINAL, I am going to use Visual Studio Code from the start.
