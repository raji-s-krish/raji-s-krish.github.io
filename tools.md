# Useful Tools

Here are some useful tutorials:

1. [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/): This is what I use to author content in this website
2. [Github Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/): This is what I use to host my website *for free* without paying $200/year.
