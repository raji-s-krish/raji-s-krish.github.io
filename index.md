# Hi, My Name is Raji Santhanakrishnan

I have managed cardiovascular clinical studies across Singapore and the USA collaborating with institutes across the world and published 16 peer-reviewed articles in clinical cardiology. 

Currently working as Clinical Research Physician at Qure.ai and learning programming (with no prior exposure) while making positive impact in the world through Qure.ai's healthcare products.
