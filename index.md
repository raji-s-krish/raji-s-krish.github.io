# Hi, My Name is Raji


I am a Physician and a Scientist with experience in managing cardiovascular clinical studies across Singapore and the USA. I collaborated with institutes across the world and published 16 peer-reviewed articles in clinical cardiology. I love to watch Korean dramas and enjoy teaching art and mehandi to my daughter.
